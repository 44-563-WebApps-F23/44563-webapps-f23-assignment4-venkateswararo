    <h5>A Doll’s House by Henrik Ibsen </h5>
    <P>[THE SAME SCENE.—The table has been placed in the middle of the stage,
        with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into
        the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above. Mrs Linde
        is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she
        tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every
        now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door.]_
        
        MRS LINDE.
        _[looking at her watch]_. Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
        does not—. _[Listens again.]_ Ah, there he is. _[Goes into the hall and
        opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
        stairs. She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Yes, why not?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Certainly—why not?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Can we two have anything to talk about?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        We have a great deal to talk about.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        I shouldn’t have thought so.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        No, you have never properly understood me.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all
        the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance
        turns up?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you
        believe that I did it with a light heart?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Didn’t you?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Nils, did you really think that?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty
        also to put an end to all that you felt for me.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        _[wringing his hands]_. So that was it. And all this—only for the sake
        of money!
        
        MRS LINDE.
        You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little
        brothers. We couldn’t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed
        hopeless then.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else’s
        sake.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Indeed I don’t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to
        do it.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        _[more gently]_. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground
        went from under my feet. Look at me now—I am a shipwrecked man clinging
        to a bit of wreckage.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        But help may be near.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your
        place I was going to take in the Bank.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not
        going to give it up to me?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        No, because that would not benefit you in the least.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Oh, benefit, benefit—I would have done it whether or no.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have
        taught me that.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But deeds you must
        believe in?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        What do you mean by that?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        I had good reason to say so.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage—no one to
        mourn for, no one to care for.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        It was your own choice.
        
        MRS LINDE.
        There was no other choice—then.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Well, what now?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        What are you saying?
        
        MRS LINDE.
        Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each
        on their own.
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Christine I...
        
        MRS LINDE.
        What do you suppose brought me to town?
        
        KROGSTAD.
        Do you mean that you gave me a thought?
